# Python-Challenge Week 3 Homework
First time turning in 5/14/23. Hope I'm turning this in correctly!

Well this was a fun challenge for sure. Utilizing the various variables, lists, dictionaries, and formats in python to make the script was interesting. 
I worked on this with some other students from class and also used google to help with syntax especially for the if/else statments
Added a screenshot in Images.
Would love any feedback to make this better!
